rails_blogpost
==============

A CRUD practice app using rails

## Blog app description

1. Each post should have a title, description and author
2. Each tag should have a name
3. Remember that many posts can have many tags, and many tags can belong to multiple posts


## How to get started

1. Generate your models and migrations and begin to model your relationships (remember this is a many to many relationship that you should model using has_many through)
2. Run your migrations and make sure you have the correct foreign key setup
3. For each model, make sure everything is working in `rails console` before you start building your routes, controllers and views (create a post, create a tag, see what posts belong to a certain tag etc.)
4. Once you have tested your models in Rails console, create the routes required to create and show data with your models.
	
		*	Setup a route, make a controller method, and the associated view for a `post`.
		*  Continue this for the resource until you've implemented your index, new, create and show actions for `post`.
		*  Then go back and add the ability to add a `tag` with your new `post`
		*  Finally make a `TagsController`
		* `#index` should show all tags
		* `#show` should show you the `title` and `author` of every `post` associated with that `tag`.
		* each `post` on the show page should include a link to the associated `post`. 
		* Use **REST**ful practices for this link and you should be fine.
